## Features

The project splited into 3 phase. Each phase has its own tag on the repository, sofar I implemented below phases:

- [x] Phase 1 - Formated Program Printer
- [x] Phase 2 - Semantic Analysis
- [x] Phase 3 - Errors Detection

## Requirements

| Platform | Minimum Java Version | Installation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | 17.0 | [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) | Tested |

## Usage

### Phase 1

for using phase one, switch to latest tag v1.0.0 to see the implementation. 
You just need to implement your own **Jython** code in `test1.cl` file and run the main function.
As a result you see the terminal/console output of the code you implemented in a spicific and general format
which can be observed inside [Templates](https://github.com/kiarashvosough1999/JCompiler/tree/master/Samples/outputTemplate).


### Phase 2

for using phase one, switch to latest tag v2.0.0 to see the implementation. 
You just need to implement your own **Jython** code in `test1.cl` file and run the main function.
As a result you see the terminal/console output of the code you implemented in a spicific and general format for each scope defined in code
which can be observed inside [Templates](https://github.com/kiarashvosough1999/JCompiler/tree/master/Samples/outputTemplate).


### Phase 3

for using phase one, switch to latest tag v2.0.0 to see the implementation. 
You just need to implement your own **Jython** code in `test1.cl` file and run the main function.
As a result you see the terminal/console output of error detected from your code including redundancy, undefined code, etc
which can be observed inside [Templates](https://github.com/kiarashvosough1999/JCompiler/tree/master/Samples/outputTemplate).
