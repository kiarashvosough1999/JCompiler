## Features

The project splited into 3 phase. Each phase has its own tag on the repository, sofar I implemented below phases:

- [x] Phase 1 - Formated Program Printer
- [ ] Phase 2 - Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Phase 3 - Errors Detection

## Requirements

| Platform | Minimum Java Version | Installation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | 17.0 | [CocoaPods](https://openjdk.java.net) | Tested |

## Usage

### Phase 1

for using phase one, switch to latest tag v1.0.0 to see the implementation. 
You just need to implement your own **Jython** code in `test1.cl` file and run the main function.
As a result you see the terminal/concol output of the code you implemented in a spicific and general format
whch can be observed inside [Templates](https://github.com/kiarashvosough1999/JCompiler/tree/master/Samples/outputTemplate).
